## Multiple paternity in birds

### /analysis_all
Contains code and data to estimate q and pB for all bird species.

### /analysis_fingerprint
Contains code and data to estimate q and pB for bird species where multiple paternity was determined using DNA fingerprinting.

### /analysis_microsat
Contains code and data to estimate q and pB for bird bird species where multiple paternity was determined using microsatellite DNA.

### /analysis_mono
Contains code and data to estimate q and pB for bird species which are considered socially monogamous.

### /analysis_xmono
Contains code and data to estimate q and pB for bird species that are *not* considered socially monogamous.

### /birds_vs_mammals
Contains code to estimate q and pB for latest collection of mammalian studies on multiple paternity, along with code comparing multiple paternity in mammals to birds examined using microsatellite DNA (including Krippendorff's alpha, clustered Wilcoxon rank sum test).

### /microsat-fingerprint
Contains code comparing multiple paternity between DNA methods: birds examined using microsatellite DNA versus bird species examined using DNA fingerprinting (including Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, McNemar test).

### /mono-xmono
Contains code comparing multiple paternity between sexual selection strategies: socially monogamous birds versus bird species that are *not* socially monogamous (including Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, clustered Wilcoxon rank sum test).

### birddata_cleaning.R
Code for cleaning and organizing bird species data before estimating q and pB.

### paternity_birds.csv
Full data of all bird species used in these analyses.
